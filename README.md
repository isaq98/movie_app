# Movie_App
Utilizing theMovieDB's API, made a basic movie searching tool to get a bit more comfortable interacting with existing code bases.

## Please Note
For obvious reasons, my API key is not included in my repo, so if you're interested in running the program 
[register for an account](https://www.themoviedb.org/signup?language=en-US) and then replace the necessary lines as commented in the files :)
